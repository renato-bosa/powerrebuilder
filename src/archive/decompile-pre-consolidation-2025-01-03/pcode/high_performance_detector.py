"""High-performance P-code detection algorithm with intelligent file segmentation.

This module provides a fast O(n) P-code detection algorithm that replaces the
current O(n²) implementation with advanced pattern matching, sliding window
confidence caching, intelligent heuristics, and file segmentation for large files.

Key improvements:
- Boyer-Moore string matching for O(n) pattern detection
- Sliding window with cached confidence scores
- Early termination when sufficient P-code is found
- Chunked processing for memory efficiency
- Heuristics to jump to likely P-code locations
- Intelligent file segmentation for large files (>1MB)
- Smart boundary detection to avoid missing P-code at segment boundaries
- Overlap processing to ensure continuity across segments

Complexity: O(n) instead of O(n²)
Memory usage: Significantly reduced through chunking and caching
Large file handling: Segmented processing instead of skipping
